Setup and start nXhtml installation.

This is for installation and updating directly from the nXhtml
development sources.

There are two different ways to install:

  (1) Download all at once: `nxhtml-setup-download-all'
  (2) Automatically download part by part: `nxhtml-setup-auto-download'

You can convert between those ways by calling this function again.
You can also do this by setting the option `nxhtml-autoload-web' yourself.

When you have nXhtml installed you can update it:

  (3) Update new files in nXhtml: `nxhtml-update-existing-files'

To learn more about nXhtml visit its home page at URL
`http://www.emacswiki.com/NxhtmlMode/'.

If you want to test auto download (but not use it further) there
is a special function for that, you answer T here:

   (T) Test automatic download part by part: `nxhtml-setup-test-auto-download'

If you want to download a zip file with latest released version instead then
please see URL `http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html'.

Set up to autoload nXhtml files from the web.

This function will download some initial files and then setup to
download the rest when you need them.

Files will be downloaded under the directory root you specify in
DL-DIR.

Note that files will not be upgraded automatically.  The auto
downloading is just for files you are missing. (This may change a
bit in the future.) If you want to upgrade those files that you
have downloaded you can just call `nxhtml-update-existing-files'.

You can easily switch between this mode of downloading or
downloading the whole of nXhtml by once.  To switch just call the
command `nxhtml-setup-install'.

See also the command `nxhtml-setup-download-all'.

Note: If your nXhtml is to old you can't use this function
      directly.  You have to upgrade first, se the function
      above. Version 2.07 or above is good for this.

If you want to download only those files you are actually using
then call `nxhtml-setup-auto-download' instead.

See the command `nxhtml-setup-install' for a convenient way to
call these commands.
